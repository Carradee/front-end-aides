# CSS stuff
make CSS easier to use

## master-stylesheet
**version: 0.01**
A master stylesheet project, intended to normalize site appearance across browsers.

### -melkor-reset.css
This is the reset file. Should work fine just with installâ€”but some of the things it overrides or converts to default can cause problems on some setups. (Ex. `:focus` is overridden.) *This includes setup for printed pages.*

### -morgoth-defaults.css
This is the the tag default stylesheet made to go with *melkor-reset.css*. Adjust as warranted to suit your project. Includes some options.

## css-post-processors
CSS postprocessor, written in PHP.

### composite-processor.php
A CSS postprocessor (written in PHP) that lets you code in individual files and will compile a single "style.css" file for you. **This is designed for install in your CSS directory.**

TO USE:
* Number your CSS files in the order you want them to cascade. (I have a recommendation for this, but it's part of a bigger file-handling method that is in process.)
* Add to your css folder and run the script. Style.css will be generated, for use in your site.

**If style.css exists, it will be overwritten.**
