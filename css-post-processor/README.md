Compile all CSS files and overwrite style.css if it differs from source files.

**Designed for use with vanilla CSS.**


## TO USE:

* Number your CSS files in the order you need them to cascade.
* Add to your CSS folder and run the script. This script will generate “style-min.css”.

**If style-min.css exists, it will be overwritten.**
